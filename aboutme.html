    <h6 style="font-size:16px;"> My Side Scroller Game </h6> 
    <p> Earlier this week my group and I created a Side Scroller game called Octoman. The purpose of this game was to use the mouse to move an octopus to avoid shark and eat fish.</p>

    <p> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that both use loops, syntax, and variables. Some differences are that these things are prewritten on Scratch, but on Python you have to write them yourself.

      I really enjoyed the activity we did today. It was really satisfying when everything was in place. One of the hard things was not getting stuck. There were many times where I would say "I'm stuck I have no idea what to do," but if I continued to try new things and with the help of the teachers I was always able to fix my problem.
