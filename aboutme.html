    <h6 style="font-size:16px;"><center>My Side Scroller Game</center></h6> 
    <p><center>
      Earlier this week my group and I created a Side Scroller game called Octoman. 
      The purpose of this game was to use the mouse to move an octopus to avoid shark and eat fish.
      Below are screenshots of the game that we created.

        One thing that I learned about how the internet works is that each computer has a unique IP Address, that makes it different.
        I think LaTex would be considered a markup language, because it formats documents. This means that it changed the outer appearance of it.
